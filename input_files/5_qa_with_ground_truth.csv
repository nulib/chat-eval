"How has the political map of Africa changed since the 19th century, and what historical events have driven these changes?","The political map of Africa has undergone significant changes since the 19th century, primarily driven by European colonization and subsequent decolonization. 

In the 19th century, maps like [Karte von Afrika](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/ccfa5745-8328-4819-ae67-5f6ccef84ae3) (1888) depict Africa with European colonial territories such as German colonies. The map includes insets showing German territories like Lüderitz-Land and Kamerun-Gebiet, reflecting the ""Scramble for Africa"" period where European powers divided the continent.

By the mid-20th century, these colonial maps were replaced by maps showing independent African nations. For instance, maps in the [16th-Early 20th Century Maps of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a) collection, such as [A new map of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/7a58ca98-d709-4d4d-8b9c-5b5074c780e9) (1805), highlight the shift from colonial divisions to national boundaries following decolonization movements in the 1950s and 1960s.

Key historical events driving these changes include the Berlin Conference (1884-1885), which formalized European claims to African territories, and the wave of independence movements post-World War II, leading to the establishment of sovereign African states.
