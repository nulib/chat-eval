How did World War II propaganda posters influence public opinion and morale during the war?,"World War II propaganda posters played a crucial role in influencing public opinion and boosting morale. They used striking visuals and compelling messages to convey the importance of unity, sacrifice, and support for the war effort. The [World War II Poster Collection](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/faf4f60e-78e0-4fbf-96ce-4ca8b4df597a) includes over 300 posters issued by various U.S. government agencies, emphasizing different themes:

1. **Unity and Resistance**: Posters like [We French workers warn you: defeat means slavery, starvation, death](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/52f515bd-2ee8-49da-aec0-92eb3f5b5e07) depicted the dire consequences of defeat to foster unity and resistance among Americans.
   
2. **Production and Labor**: Posters such as [Your ore packs a punch!](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/1792fa95-dbe0-488b-bb09-6d2416b1325e) and [Kinda give it your personal attention, will you?: more production](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/b64eefac-d63a-43f6-a4e6-bcdd62222f3f) encouraged increased production and labor contribution, appealing directly to workers' sense of duty and patriotism.

"How has the political map of Africa changed since the 19th century, and what historical events have driven these changes?","The political map of Africa has undergone significant changes since the 19th century, primarily driven by European colonization and subsequent decolonization. 

In the 19th century, maps like [Karte von Afrika](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/ccfa5745-8328-4819-ae67-5f6ccef84ae3) (1888) depict Africa with European colonial territories such as German colonies. The map includes insets showing German territories like Lüderitz-Land and Kamerun-Gebiet, reflecting the ""Scramble for Africa"" period where European powers divided the continent.

By the mid-20th century, these colonial maps were replaced by maps showing independent African nations. For instance, maps in the [16th-Early 20th Century Maps of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a) collection, such as [A new map of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/7a58ca98-d709-4d4d-8b9c-5b5074c780e9) (1805), highlight the shift from colonial divisions to national boundaries following decolonization movements in the 1950s and 1960s.

Key historical events driving these changes include the Berlin Conference (1884-1885), which formalized European claims to African territories, and the wave of independence movements post-World War II, leading to the establishment of sovereign African states.

For detailed studies, explore maps by conducting keyword searches such as [Africa 19th Century](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?q=Africa+19th+Century) and [Colonial Maps](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?q=Colonial+Maps). The [16th-Early 20th Century Maps of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a) collection is particularly relevant for understanding these transformations.","The political map of Africa has undergone significant changes since the 19th century, primarily driven by colonization and the subsequent decolonization movements. Initially, Africa was divided into territories controlled by various European powers, as evidenced by historical maps such as the 1888 [Karte von Afrika](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/ccfa5745-8328-4819-ae67-5f6ccef84ae3), which shows German colonies in Africa. This period, known as the Scramble for Africa, saw European nations establishing colonies across the continent.

The mid-20th century marked the beginning of the decolonization process, where African countries gained independence from European rule. This period significantly altered the political boundaries, leading to the formation of modern nation-states. For instance, the [A new and accurate map of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/ba8b6ce8-103e-4dc4-92b8-31ad56e28511) from 1777 or 1778 and the 1805 [A new map of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/7a58ca98-d709-4d4d-8b9c-5b5074c780e9) depict Africa as divided into regions based on European colonial interests, reflective of the political landscape before the wave of independence.

To explore these changes in detail, one can look into the [16th-Early 20th Century Maps of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a) collection, which provides a comprehensive overview of Africa's political evolution. Relevant keyword searches include [colonization](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?q=colonization), [decolonization](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?q=decolonization), and [African independence](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?q=African%20independence). These searches will yield resources that illustrate the historical events driving the political changes in Africa.","[{'accession_number': 'Accession:inu-afrmap-4221612', 'alternate_title': [], 'api_link': 'https://dcapi.rdc-staging.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/ccfa5745-8328-4819-ae67-5f6ccef84ae3', 'canonical_link': 'https://dc.rdc-staging.library.northwestern.edu/items/ccfa5745-8328-4819-ae67-5f6ccef84ae3', 'caption': [], 'collection': {'description': ""This collection features digital copies of 113 antique maps of Africa and accompanying text dating from the mid-16th Century to the early 20th Century.

All scanned maps are authentic and originally collected by the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies. Melville J. Herskovits established Northwestern University's Program of African Studies in 1948 (the first of its kind at a major research university in the United States). The Herskovits Library, formally created as a separate library in 1954, has since its inception collected maps that describe Africa from their earliest appearance to the most current. Map area coverage includes the continent, regions (particularly North Africa and Algeria), islands (particularly Madagascar), and a few city plans. All of these maps are loose items, though many have been excised from published atlases. Some of the highlights of the digital collection are: a series of Ptolemic maps of North Africa by Ruscelli, ca. 1565; Forlani: Africa , 1562; Mercator: Africa, 1595; Blaeu: Æthiopia ca. 1650 (a Prester John map); Carey: Africa, 1795 (first map of Africa published in the United States), Arrowsmith: Africa, 1802 (notable for its large dimensions, 124 x 145 cm.), a series of Algerian maps published by the French government in the mid-1800's, and maps by other notable cartographers, such as Hondius, Jansson, de Jode, de L'Isle, Ortelius, Sanson, and de Wit. The original maps are kept and maintained in the map collection in the Government & Geographic Information Collection. We welcome questions, comments, and suggestions concerning any aspect of this digital collection, particularly with regards to provenance.
