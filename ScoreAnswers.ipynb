The [16th-Early 20th Century Maps of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a) collection is particularly relevant for understanding these transformations.', 'The political map of Africa has undergone significant changes since the 19th century, driven primarily by European colonization and later by the decolonization movements of the mid-20th century.\\n\\n1. **19th Century European Colonization**:\\n    - Maps like [Karte von Afrika](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/ccfa5745-8328-4819-ae67-5f6ccef84ae3) (1888) highlight the division of Africa into territories controlled by European powers such as Germany, France, and Britain. This period is characterized by the \"Scramble for Africa,\" where European nations competed to annex large parts of the continent.\\n\\n2. **Decolonization**:\\n    - Following World War II, a wave of independence movements swept across Africa, leading to the collapse of colonial empires and the formation of new sovereign states. This is reflected in the shift from maps like [A new and accurate map of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/ba8b6ce8-103e-4dc4-92b8-31ad56e28511) (circa 1777-1778), which depict European colonial territories, to more modern maps showing independent nations.\\n\\n3. **Significant Historical Events**:\\n    - The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 formalized the \"Scramble for Africa,\" resulting in the arbitrary division of the continent among European powers.\\n    - The rise of independence movements in the mid-20th century, inspired by global decolonization trends and fueled by World War II\\'s aftermath, led to the independence of numerous African countries between the 1950s and 1970s.\\n\\nFor a deeper exploration of these changes, consider searching for [colonial Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?q=colonial+Africa) and [decolonization](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?q=decolonization) in the [16th-Early 20th Century Maps of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a) collection. This collection is particularly relevant as it includes maps from the period of colonization to early independence, offering a comprehensive view of Africa\\'s political evolution.', '90', 'The submitted answer accurately captures the key points of the correct answer, including the changes in the political map of Africa due to European colonization in the 19th century and the subsequent decolonization movements in the mid-20th century. The answer also mentions the significant historical events that drove these changes, such as the Berlin Conference and the rise of independence movements. The only minor difference is that the submitted answer does not go into as much detail as the correct answer, but it still covers the essential information. Overall, the submitted answer is a very good match to the correct answer.', True]]\n"
